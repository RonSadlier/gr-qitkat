QITKAT - Quantum Information ToolKit for Application Testing

Installation:
We do not require any dependencies other than those for GNU Radio.

Like GNU Radio, we use CMake. A typical installation process looks like
the following:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ make test
$ sudo make install

Known Issues:
- The block ecc_repetition_decode seems to drop samples for k>7. A
  work around for this issue is to manually set the buffer size of the
  sdc_decode block in the flowgraph.
